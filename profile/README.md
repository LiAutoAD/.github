# Welcome to LiAuto Autonomous Driving Team's GitHub Repository!

## Introduction

The LiAuto Autonomous Driving (AD) Team is at the forefront of revolutionizing transportation through cutting-edge autonomous driving technologies. Our mission is to develop innovative solutions that enhance safety, efficiency, and sustainability in the mobility sector. This repository serves as a central hub for our groundbreaking projects, including advancements in Large Language Models (LLM) for AD, World Models for AD simulation, 3D Geometric Scene (3DGS) understanding for city scenes, and comprehensive End-to-End Neural Network (NN) Models for autonomous driving systems.

## Our Projects

### Large Language Models (LLM) for Autonomous Driving

We leverage the power of LLMs to interpret and understand complex driving scenarios, enabling more intelligent and responsive autonomous vehicles.

### World Models in AD Simulation

Our World Models project aims to simulate realistic driving environments for testing and improving autonomous driving algorithms under various conditions.

### 3D Geometric Scene (3DGS) Understanding for City Scenes

The 3DGS project focuses on creating detailed 3D maps of urban environments, enhancing the perception systems of autonomous vehicles for better navigation and decision-making.

### End-to-End Neural Network (NN) Models for Autonomous Driving

We are pioneering the development of comprehensive End-to-End NN models that streamline the processing pipeline of autonomous driving systems, from perception to actuation.
